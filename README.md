# Data-Science-Capstone-Project
Coursera's Data Science Capstone Project


This is the repository of files produced for the Data Sience Capstone Project on Coursera in partnership of JHU and Switkey.

The goal was to produce a word prediction algorithm aiming at proposing a probable word after an user input sentence.

This repository contains the files that are necessary to run a Shiny-application running the prediction model, and files for the Rpubs presentation presenting the Shiny-application.

The prediction model is using Markov Chain Model and Katz's Back-Off Model.
